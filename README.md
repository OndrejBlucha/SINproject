### Registration for project

During this week or sometime in first half of next week is supposed to be open.

### Description of what we need to do

We are supposed to use (if possible) already existing systems that are used for what we decided to work on.
Purpose of this project supposed to be chance for us to make ourselves familiatr and thinker with something new.
As the most interesting, of first four topics so far gathered above, for our teacher is the last one "Orchestration
of cleaning robots". So we should find already existing system which orchestrates these cleaning robots, integrate
it with JADE (or other tool which will serve us for simulation creation) in which we will implement the environment
and individual controled agens. That will allow us to make the simulation on that existing system and gain presentable
results. As the last step we are supposed to develop documentation between 10 to 20 pages with pictures included
with description of our problem, our solution and our results. For more information, please leave comment or ask
our teacher with specific question.

More details to come. (Maybe ...?!)

### Managment of the project

I created few issues (and more issues will be appearing as we progress) What needs to be done. Please leave
your comments at these specific issues. Add more issues if needed. Pick some issue and assign it to your self
by leaving comment "Assigned" or "Taken" in the specific issue because unfortunately there is no way to assign
issues outside organizations. (Or at least I couldn't figure out how to do that.) If noone takes the issue, I will
assign them to you (or to my self) by leaving "Assigned to: @name" comment.

If you create pull request (PR) that supposed to be solution to some issue reference the issue in the PR it self.

### Current situation

Nothing to report yet.
